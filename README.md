Our Gift the Code submission for Holland Bloorview

Our submission is designed to help Holland Bloorview move from paper surveys to computer-based surveys. The system is an instance of Drupal 7 using many many Webform modules. We created a system where questions can be easily input and the survey results available for immediate, simple, analysis. The results can also be downloaded in multiple formats for other kinds of analysis: using SPSS for example.

The system can be used to recreate the existing styles of survey forms. In this way HB staff can begin to use the system with a minimal amount of training. HB staff can also ramp up their surveys: this would include the use of images that would help HB to create surveys that could be given to subjects who cannot read or who are only able to make simple physical movements. We have created a system that could be more motivating for test subjects and where the information could be collected with a minimal bias or impact from the test giver.
